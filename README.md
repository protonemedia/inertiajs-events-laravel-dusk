## Laravel Splade

**Did you hear about Laravel Splade? 🤩**

It's the *magic* of Inertia.js with the *simplicity* of Blade. [Splade](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-splade) provides a super easy way to build Single Page Applications using Blade templates. Besides that magic SPA-feeling, it comes with more than ten components to sparkle your app and make it interactive, all without ever leaving Blade.

## Blogpost

If you want to know more about the background of this package, please read the blogpost: [A package for Laravel Dusk to wait for Inertia.js events](https://protone.media/en/blog/a-package-for-laravel-dusk-to-wait-for-inertiajs-events)

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require protonemedia/inertiajs-events-laravel-dusk --dev
```

Add the `inertiaEventsCount` object to your main JavaScript file, somewhere above the creation of the Vue application instance.

```js
window.inertiaEventsCount = {
    navigateCount: 0,
    successCount: 0,
    errorCount: 0,
}
```

In the creation of the Vue application instance, use the `mounted` method to register the [event listeners](https://inertiajs.com/events).

```js
import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'

new Vue({
  mounted() {
    Inertia.on('navigate', (event) => {
      window.inertiaEventsCount.navigateCount++;
    })

    Inertia.on('success', (event) => {
      window.inertiaEventsCount.successCount++;
    })

    Inertia.on('error', (event) => {
      window.inertiaEventsCount.errorCount++;
    })
  }
})
```

## Usage

This package provides three helper methods for your Laravel Dusk tests.

### Error
The `waitForInertiaError()` method may be used to wait until the [Error](https://inertiajs.com/events#error) event is fired. You can use it to assert against responses where validation errors are returned.

### Navigate
The `waitForInertiaNavigate()` method may be used to wait until the [Navigate](https://inertiajs.com/events#navigate) event is fired. You can use it to assert a user is redirected, for example, after submitting a form.

### Success
The `waitForInertiaSuccess()` method may be used to wait until the [Success](https://inertiajs.com/events#success) event is fired. This is great for testing forms that don't redirect after successfully submitting a form.

### Example test

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Browser;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\DatabaseMigrations;
use Tests\DuskTestCase;

class ExampleTest extends DuskTestCase
{
    use DatabaseMigrations;

    /**
     * A basic browser test example.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function it_can_store_a_user_and_redirect_back_to_the_index_route()
    {
        $this->browse(function ($browser) {
            $browser->loginAs(User::first())
                    ->visit(route('user.create'))
                    ->type('name', 'New User')
                    ->press('Submit')
                    ->waitForInertiaNavigate()
                    ->assertRouteIs('user.index')
                    ->assertSee('User Added!');
        });
    }
}
```
